							About Me
						</h2>
					</div>
					<p>Kia Ora! I'm Thomas, a passionate future software developer in my third year at Auckland University of Technology, where I'm completing my Bachelor's in Computer and Information Sciences. My major in Software Development, coupled with minors in Networking & Cyber Security and Creative Technologies, equips me with a robust technical foundation and a flair for creative problem-solving.</p>

                    <p>From a young age, I've been fascinated by the magic of code and its potential to transform ideas into tangible solutions. This fascination turned into a vocation as I began my academic journey in Aotearoa New Zealand, a place that has nurtured my aspirations and widened my perspectives on innovation in the IT sector. I relish the challenge of integrating the logic of programming with the creativity of culinary arts to cook up projects that are as delightful as they are functional.</p>

                    <p>With a portfolio that includes various programs and websites, I bring a blend of creativity and technical expertise to the table. My enthusiasm for all things IT is matched by a commitment to excellence and a proven ability to adapt and learn swiftly, ensuring that I can meet the challenges of this industry.</p>

                    <p>I'm committed to becoming a software developer who not only writes clean, efficient code but also deeply understands user and business needs. With a proactive attitude and a tireless work ethic, I am ready to dive into the world of software development, bringing with me a dedication to continuous improvement and excellence.</p>

                    <p>My work ethic is underpinned by honesty and a strong sense of motivation, which, when combined with my time management skills, makes me an asset in collaborative environments. I'm keen on taking my practical knowledge further by engaging in opportunities that enrich my experience and contribute to my career aspirations.</p>

                    <p>Reliable and ready to tackle any task, I am looking forward to adding value to future projects and teams while embracing the chance to learn from industry peers. My goal is to forge a successful career path in IT, driven by a belief that through hard work and continual learning, I can achieve excellence in my endeavors.</p>

                    <p>I invite you to peruse my portfolio to see the innovation and meticulous care I invest in my work. If you're looking for someone with a fresh perspective and a relentless drive to create outstanding software, let's connect! I am keen to join a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer, and I look forward to discussing how we can collaborate to build exceptional IT solutions.</p>
